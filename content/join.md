# Join us!

Currently, the AIEA lab is at *capacity* and not seeking new students
to join at this time.  We will update this page as openings become
available.


Interested students are welcome to complete the lab interest [form](https://forms.gle/CpmrgSxGSUvDWo3J7).
We examine new applicants at the start of each academic quarter (excluding summer).  

## Prospective PhD students
<!-- The AIEA group takes on 0-2 new PhD students each year.-->
For the 2025-2026 academic year, due to the group size and uncertainty of research funds, we are not recruiting PhD students.

<!-- We are seeking creative, hard-working, PhD students to join and lead the group.

Come work with us on making complex mechanisms more understandable for
debugging and diagnosis, accountability, and liability.  We examine
applications in autonomous driving, deep learning, and other
mission-critical or safety-critical applications.  Additionally, the
AIEA lab also examines the role of explanations for trustworthy ML,
human-machine teams, AI and ethics, and AI safety and fairness.  See our [active projects](/project) for more information. -->

## UCSC Master's students {#ucsc-master-s-students}

Current UCSC Master's students interested in gaining research
experience or looking for a supervisor for a research project should examine the [active projects](/project) and identify a potential research fit.  You will need to take an independent study and define a [syllabus](https://www.notion.so/aiea/Independent-Study-Guidelines-2ae3eb5c200242ca8c25292aad2b8082?source=copy_link#271c03a14c2c801cb390daea399636ef) and expectations for the project.  

MS students in the AIEA group can either do a capstone project (which will take approximately 2-3 quarters), or a thesis (which will take at least 1 year).  MS students in the AIEA group are expected to to advise and mentor 1-2 undergraduate students.  

In your introductory email, please include a CV/resume, and indicate a
few topics or application domains of interest.  You will propose your own project for an independent study based on this template.  We've listed a couple
ongoing projects on the [UCSC CSE master's board](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/cse\/masters_projects).

## UCSC undergrad {#ucsc-undergrad}
We have a structured initiative to onboard new prospective members to the lab: the AIEA Lab Auditor program.  You can
read more about it [here](https://aiea.notion.site/AIEA-Lab-Auditors-90636fde68f84e8f9e05ff0442c327ec?pvs=4). Through this program, you will need to enroll in [CMPM 118](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW7SMcXHKQSeylWsF-lY_ugTXcJzwnlo6jGlUSql4TI/edit?usp=sharing).

The expected commitment is ~10 hours per week where you will learn about:

-   Compute: Nautilus and our computing frameworks.
-   Task system: Notion and github tasks.
-   Documentation: Notion.
-   Code: Github
-   Complete a group project with 2-3 students.
